### Instructions 

#### Preparing Beans

If you're using dried beans, soak them for at least 12 hours before hand. 

#### Chili Instructions
1. Dice all your veggies into approximately centimeter sized pieces. Keep the tomatoes separate from
2. Mince the garlic
3. Turn on your Instant Pot to Saute
4. Add olive oil to the pot and add your garlic and onion.
5. Stir until fragrant.
6. Add your meat and cook until mostly cooked through (it's okay if it's not entirely brown as it will continue cooking)
7. Add your other veggies. Generally, sweet potato and carrots should be added first (as they take longer to cook) and add the tomatoes last.
8. Continually stir for around 3-5 minutes. Once the meat and veggies start to release liquid and its bubbling a bit, add the stock/water.
9. At this point, add the beans, lentils and spices and stir.
10. Cook at high pressure for 15 minutes.
11. Turn off the Instant Pot and let it naturally release steam for around 10 minutes. Then you can manually release the rest.
12. If the chili looks too water-y, turn it back on to Saute and let it thicken. Be sure to stir it during this time.
13. Taste and add spices/salt as necessary.


### Notes
* Generally, you should not need to cook the beans before cooking the chili because they should cook and soften with everything else. However, if you feel more comfortable, you can also separately pressure cook the beans beforehand.
