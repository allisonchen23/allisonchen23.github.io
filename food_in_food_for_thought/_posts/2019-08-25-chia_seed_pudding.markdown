Okay but that's kinda boring, here are some <span class="standOut">variations</span> to add some flavor! Add these before refrigerating

#### Coconut Spice

Maybe an unconventional combination, but it's really good!

1. Mix in **1 TBSP cinnamon, 1/2 TBSP nutmeg, and as much shredded coconut as you want**.
2. Stir again, ensuring everything is mixed well
3. Before eating, top with raspberries and almond butter

#### Health benefits: 

Chia seeds are an *excellent* source of fiber! They're pretty low in calories, but adding a little bit to your breakfast can help keep you full for longer, especially useful if you're working towards being in a calorie deficit without always feeling so hungry! 

But sometimes the texture is unappealing; to be honest, the first time I had chia seed pudding, I did not like it at all but it's grown on me, especially when you add in other ingredients. By itself, chia seed pudding tastes like almost nothing, but in a way that's good becuase you get to start with a blank slate and flavor it any way you want!

Thanks for reading, and I'll *chia* later!

(Get it? Like *see ya* later?)

Okay, I get it, I get it, I'm leaving now.
