### Ingredients
* Whatever you're roasting (the base)
* Olive oil
* Optional spices (salt & pepper, for example)

### Instructions 
1. Toss your base with the olive oil and spices in a bowl until the base is just covered.
2. On a baking sheet, place down some parchment paper or aluminum foil and spread out your base
3. Place in oven at specified temperature for [time interval 1], then mix it around a bit and leave it in the oven for [time interval 2]

Refer to the tables below for proportions, oven temperatures, and durations
#### Nuts

I always do approximately 2 cups of nuts with 1 TBSP of olive oil, no spices.


| Nut       | Temperature (F)   | Time Interval 1 (minutes) | Time Interval 2 (minutes) |
| :----:    | :----:            | :----:                    | :----:                    | 
| Almonds   | 350               | 8                         | 4                         |
| Pecans    | 325               | 5-6                         | 3                         |
| Walnuts   | 350               | 6                         | 4                         |

#### Vegetables

I'd do approximately 3-4 cups of veggies with 1.5 TBSP olive oil, with salt and pepper.
With roasting veggies, the rule of thumb is higher temperature for vegetables with more water!

| Veggie       | Temperature (F)   | Time Interval 1 (minutes) | Time Interval 2 (minutes) |
| :----:    | :----:            | :----:                    | :----:                    | 
| Butternut Squash   | 400               | 10-12                         | 10-12                         |
| Zucchini & Summer Squash    | 450               | 10-12                  | 10-12                      |
| Broccoli & Cauliflower   | 425               | 10-12                         | 10-12                  |

#### Nutrition Discussion

Roasted nuts for me are a perfect snack and addition for when I make my homemade granola! Feel free to find your own spice recipes and play around with it. 

Roasted veggies are perfect for meal prepping! It's very little effort to make, and while they're roasting, you can do literally whatever you need to. They're a perfect addition to quinoa bowls, salads, and rice bowls!
