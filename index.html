						<h2>Hey there!</h2>
						<p>I'm Allison Chen, and I'm originally from Chicago, Illinois. Currently, I'm a first year undergraduate computer science student at University of California, Los Angeles. I'm especially interested in machine learning and data science, and my ideal job would be applying these into traditionally not computer science-y fields to create personal impacts on society, preferably somehow related to preventative health with diet and nutrition! Apart from being a total nerd, I really enjoy the arts, especially dance and painting. I also really enjoy learning new skills and picking up hobbies; at the moment I'm learning to cook and meal prep--it was a rocky beginning, but I'm starting to get the hang of it!

			<h2>Inspiration</h2>
			<p>My love for engineering and innovation started in fifth grade when I joined an all girls FIRST Lego League team through Girl Scouts. I continued this through middle school where my team won the Illinois Championship in 2012 and 2014 and was the runner up team and nationals in 2014. Here, enjoy some embarrassing pictures of middle school me:

			<p>In high school, I continued competing in robotics first through FIRST Tech Challenge then through VEX robotics. In robotics, I was able to explore both the building/mechanical side as well as the coding/computer science side and when it was time to apply for college I reached this conclusion: I really loved both! On one hand, I enjoyed creating a design for what the robot would look like and how it would function and being able to turn that into reality. On the other, I loved actually giving the robot life through coding and innovating new ways to allow the robot to complete various tasks. Thus, I went into college with an open mind and exploring both to see which I liked better.</p>
			<p>Long story short, as you probably guessed, I chose computer science. I really loved the logical thinking behind this field and applying constant principles in new and innovative ways to create faster, better, and more complex programs. As I learned more about the field, I found myself always inquiring to learn even more and it soon dawned on me that this was something I was actually interested in.</p>
