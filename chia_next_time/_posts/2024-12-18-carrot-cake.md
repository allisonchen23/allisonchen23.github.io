### Ingredients

#### Cake

Dry ingredients:
* 2 cups (260g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
* 2 teaspoons baking soda, important to level the teaspoon, see tips
* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

Wet ingredients:
* 1 1/4 cups (295ml) vegetable oil (or butter)
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* scant 1 cup (190g) lightly packed brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 4 large eggs, at room temperature

Mix-ins:
* 3 cups (300g) grated peeled carrots, 5 to 6 medium carrots (if you have a food processor with a shredding attachment, it makes your life much easier)
* 1 1/4 cup (120g) coarsely chopped pecans (I just break them with my hands)
* 1/2 cup (70g) golden raisins
* 1 cup pineapple chunks (I buy fresh ones and cut 1 cm cubed pieces)

#### Cream Cheese Frosting
* 8 oz cream cheese, room temp
* 1/4-1/3 cup unsalted butter, room temp
* 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar (I like my frosting less sweet, but you can always add more if you'd like)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
* Pinch of salt

This is enough frosting if you are baking in a large dish (e.g. 9x13) and just want to cover the top. If you're planning on doing a layered cake, try doubling it?

### Instructions 

#### Making the Cake
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C).
2. Get a medium bowl for the dry ingredients and a larger bowl for the wet (you will pour the dry into the wet)
3. Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves) in a medium bowl until very well blended.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla.
5. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each one.
6. Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the dry ingredients in three parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth.
7. Stir in the carrots, nuts, raisins, and pineapple.
8. Grease a 9 x 13 baking dish (or two 9 inch cake pans). Pour batter into baking dishes. (Original recipe said to "line the bottom with parchment paper, and then grease the top. Or grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans." I never bothered with that)
9. Bake around 35 to 45 minutes, until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
10. Allow the cakes to cool. If using cake pans, cool the cakes in the pans for 15 minutes, then carefully turn the cake layers out onto cooling racks. Remove the parchment paper and cool completely. If you find that a cake layer is sticking to the bottom of the pan, leave the cake pan upside down and allow gravity to do its thing.

#### Making the Frosting
1. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. 
2. Add the powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. 
3. Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin, a little milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.

#### Asembling
1. Once the cake has cooled, spread frosting on top! You can also sift cinnamon or other spices on top for a nice decor. If making layered cakes, I'll refer you to the links below
