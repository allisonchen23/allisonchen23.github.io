### Ingredients
* Handful of asparagus stalks (around 10-15)
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
* juice from half a small lemon
* salt and pepper
* olive oil

### Instructions 
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit
2. Wash asparagus and break off the bottoms if they are old (if they're fibrous)
3. Pat dry with paper towel
4. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper
5. Sprinkle salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil
6. Roll the asparagus around to evenly spread the oil, salt, and pepper
7. Squeeze the lemon juice and spread out the minced garlic on top
8. Bake for 8 minutes
9. Increase heat to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for another two minutes. This is to get the asparagus to be crispier on the outside while still juicy on the inside
10. Serve and enjoy!
