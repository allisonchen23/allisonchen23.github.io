Welcome to Chia Next Time! Nutrition and healthy eating is a huge passion of mine, but I always struggle to find time to make food. In this blog, I'll be posting about various nutrition tips and ways to stay healthy as well as some of my favorite recipes. Feel free to also check out my instagram [@chia_next_time](https://www.instagram.com/chia_next_time/).

Unlike most blogs, my recipes will be at the <span class="standOut">top of each page</span> so you guys don't have to go digging for them :)

Oh, and another thing, I don't always measure out how much I put, but I've done my best approximations for you. Cooking is a science! Experiment and find out what works best for you.

Enjoy!
