		<p>I'm a first year PhD student at Princeton University studying computer science, and I'm interested in the intersection of computer vision and cognitive science. </p>
		<p>I completed my B.S. in computer science with a minor in cognitive science from UCLA in 2022. At UCLA, I was an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="http://vision.ucla.edu/">UCLA Vision Lab</a> where I worked under Dr. Stefano Soatto and with <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~alexw/">Dr. Alex Wong</a>. I was also involved with the Society of Women Engineers @ UCLA where I led the <a href="https://samueli.ucla.edu/engineering-for-humanity-research-symposium/">Engineering For Humanity Research Symposium</a> to make academic research more accessible to undergraduates.</p>
		<p>I'm passionate about making academia more accessible to all students, regardless of background. If you have questions about research, navigating college, or thinking about grad school, <b>please shoot me an email</b>, I'd be more than happy to chat :) </p>
		<p>I'm a huge travel nerd and I love to learn about different cultures especially through food. I love to cook, paint, read, go on hikes and rock climbing, and play Spikeball!</p>
